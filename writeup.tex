Given two graphs $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$, the Graph Isomorphism (GI) problem conjectures:

\textbf{Does there exist a bijection } $\phi: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ \textbf{ such that } $\{u, v\} \in E_1 \iff \{\phi(u), \phi(v)\} \in E_2$?

GI is considered to be in NP but not known to be NP-complete or in P. Babai's breakthrough in 2015 established a quasipolynomial-time algorithm:

\[
\text{Time complexity: } n^{\mathcal{O}(\log^c n)} \text{ for some constant } c \in \mathbb{R}
\]

\section*{Zero-Knowledge Proof: Soundness and Completeness}

Suppose the prover knows an isomorphism $\pi$ such that $G_2 = \pi(G_1)$.
Each round of the GMW protocol follows this pattern:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The prover selects a random permutation $\sigma$, computes $H = \sigma(G_1)$, and commits that value to $H$.
    \item The verifier then randomly selects the challenge $b \in \{0, 1\}$.
    \item If $b = 0$, the prover reveals $\sigma$, and the verifier checks whether $H = \sigma(G_1)$.  
          If $b = 1$, the prover reveals $\sigma \circ \pi^{-1}$, and the verifier checks whether $H = \sigma \circ \pi^{-1}(G_2)$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Completeness}

When the prover actually knows $\pi$, they can correctly respond to either challenge. This implies that an honest verifier will always accept:

\[
\mathbb{P}[\text{Verifier accepts} \mid \text{honest prover}] = 1
\]

\subsection*{Soundness}

Without knowledge of $\pi$, the prover can only prepare for one challenge type — not both.  
Therefore, the probability of successful deception in a single round is at most $\frac{1}{2}$. Across $t$ rounds:

\[
\mathbb{P}[\text{Cheating prover succeeds in all rounds}] \leq \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^t
\]

For example:  
Using $t = 10$ rounds produces a soundness error no greater than $\frac{1}{1024}$.

For any verifier, there exists a simulator capable of producing transcripts indistinguishable from real protocol executions by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating a random $H$
    \item Anticipating a challenge $b$
    \item Revealing the appropriate permutation
\end{itemize}

Since the simulator requires no knowledge of the actual isomorphism, this satisfies the zero-knowledge property.

\subsection*{Fiat-Shamir Heuristic (Non-Interactive)}

To eliminate interaction requirements, the verifier's challenge can be substituted with:

\[
b = \text{SHA-256}(\text{commitment} \parallel \text{round index}) \mod 2
\]

This approach makes the proof independently verifiable offline, assuming the hash function behaves as a random oracle.
